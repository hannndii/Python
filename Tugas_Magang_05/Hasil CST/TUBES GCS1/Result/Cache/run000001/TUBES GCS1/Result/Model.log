                      The length on grid (10 [mm]) of the discrete edge port "1" is longer than half
                      the minimum simulation wavelength (0.666205 [mm]).The assumption of a uniformly
                      distributed element does not hold any more and does not consider wave
                      propagation phenomena along the element. The distributed update schema could
                      therefore lead to inaccurate results.  More...
